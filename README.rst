LINZ.station_coord_model package
=======================

LINZ station coordinate model (aka station prediction model) package.

This package provides python routines for analysing time series of station coordinates, typically from daily processing of 
GNSS data.  These use the python numpy and matplotlib modules.

The main python modules provided are:

LINZ.CORS_Timeseries
   Provides functions for reading coordinate time series from CSV files, SQLite database files (as generated by 
   LINZ GNSS daily processing scripts), and directories of CSV files.  Provides routines for comparing and plotting
   time series.

LINZ.StationCoordinateModel
   Routines for reading, writing, and calculating station coordinate models - models of station coordinate time series
   including offsets, ramps, slow slip models, velocity changes, etc.  Models are stored in an XML format.  These models
   are used in the PositioNZ-PP GNSS post processing service.

The module installs a number of programs including:

analyse_cors
   Analyse coordinate time series to compare with existing station coordinate models and deformation model.
   Create CSV files of coordinate offsets and of model coordinates and a JSON file summarizing the status.

report_datum_status
   Sends notifications based on the datum status from analyse_cors

cors_station_coordinates
   Exports station coordinates from time series files into CSV files.  Coordinates can be converted
   to NZGD2000 using the published deformation model files.  Optionally different versions of the 
   deformation model can be used and compared.

spm_editor
   GUI tool for calculating station coordinate models based on time series data

station_coord_model
   Calculates coordinates for requested time periods from station coordinate models

calc_refstation_coords
   Generates a CSV file of the coordinates of LINZ reference stations at a specific date.
   Combines information from the station coordinate models and the deformation model to
   calculate the NZGD2000 coordinate at the reference date, and compares this with the
   coordinate in the geodetic database.  Optionally creates a CSV file that can be used
   to update Landonline/geodetic database coordinates.
