        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>Using the station prediction model editor requires the following components (versions listed are those
        it is built with - others may work!)
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python verson 2.7.  Note that this will not work with python 3.x</li>
            <li>Python modules numpy (1.6.2), scipy (0.10.1), matplotlib (1.2.1), PyQt4 (4.9.1)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As currently built the editor modules (spm_editor.py, stn_pred_model.py, ellipsoid.py) should be
        installed in a single directory with the models in a "models" subdirectory, and the time series data
        in a "timeseries" subdirectory.
        </p>
        <p>
        To run the editor just use "python spm_editor.py".
        </p>
        <h1>Configuration</h1>
        <p>The editor may be configured by editing the spm_editor.cfg file that is in the same directory
        as the editor itself.  The configuration allows setting the templates for the names of model files, 
        backup files, and time series files.  Each file must include the string <tt>{code}</tt> that 
        will be substituted by the four letter station code.  The backup file may also include the strings
        <tt>{fdate}</tt> and <tt>{fdatetime}</tt>, that will be replaced with the file date, or file date/time
        to create backup file names.  The editor assumes that all time series files are in the same 
        directory.  A sample configuration file is:
        </p>
        <pre>

# Configuration data for the Station Prediction Model editor
#
#  model_dir is the directory in which models are located

model_file        stations/{code}_spm.xml
model_backup_file {model_file}.{fdatetime}.backup

timeseries_file   timeseries/{code}_igs08_xyz.dat

        </pre>
        </p>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
        The station prediction model editor is used to view CORS station time series and develop station
        prediction models representing the time series.  Models can have the following components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>offset: A constant offset relative to the reference coordinate for the station</li>
            <li>velocity: A constant velocity</li>
            <li>annual: An annual cyclic signal (cos/sin)</li>
            <li>semiannual: A semiannual cyclic signal (cos/sin)</li>
            <li>equipment_offset: A step offset in the position at a given time</li>
            <li>tectonic_offset: A step offset in the position at a given time, the same as an 
            equipment offset in effect, but assigned to a tectonic origin</li>
            <li>exponential_decay: Represents post seismic relaxation by an exponential decay</li>
            <li>slow_slip: A slow slip event represented by an error function</li>
            <li>slow_slip_ramp: A slow slip event represented by an ramp function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Station prediction models are stored as XML files in the stations directory (by default).</p>
        <p>Time series data are stored text files in the timeseries directory.  The time series are
        daily IGS08 solutions.  The file is formatted as the following example:
        </p>

        <h1>Usage</h1>

        The editor can be started using the following command:
<pre>
usage: spm_editor [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-m DEFAULT_MODEL_FILE]
                  [-t DEFAULT_TIMESERIES_FILE]
                  [model_file] [timeseries_file]

View and update GNSS time series models

positional arguments:
  model_file            Station prediction model XML file
  timeseries_file       XYZ time series to use with the model

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                        Configuration file for the job
  -m DEFAULT_MODEL_FILE, --default_model_file DEFAULT_MODEL_FILE
                        Default file name for the model file - must include
                        {code}
  -t DEFAULT_TIMESERIES_FILE, --default_timeseries_file DEFAULT_TIMESERIES_FILE
                        Default file name for the model file - must include
                        {code}
</pre>
        <p>
        Optionally a SPM model file and timeseries file can be specified on the command line.  
        Otherwise it will find all time series files (based on the configuration file time series filename pattern)
        and then look for corresponding station prediction models (or create new model files if there is not 
        already one).
        </p>
        <p>
        The command line options also allow specifying a configuration file (default is ~/.spm_editor.cfg, or
        a spm_editor.cfg file in the same directory as the program). The model_file and timeseries_file 
        configuration options can be overridden on the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the model file is not specified on the command line, then the codes of the matching 
        time series files are displayed in a dropdown list.  When a code is selected
        the corresponding time series data are displayed (as E,N,U offsets from a reference point), and
        the station prediction model (SPM) is loaded, if it exists.  The editor can be used to update the 
        model, adding and removing components, and fitting the components to the timeseries.  It can also 
        be used to select bad observations that should be removed from the time series.
        </p>
        <img width="100%" src="spm_editor.png" />
        <p>
        The top half of the editor displays the time series for the selected stations, and the bottom has
        from left to right:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The station selector</li>
            <li>Modelled stations only: if selected then only stations with existing models will be displayed.
            For timeseries without a model, a default model is generated consisting of just the offset, velocity, 
            annual, and semiannual terms, all set to zero offsets.</li>
            <li>Summary statistics.  The obs statistics are based on the 95%ile of the difference between
            adjacent observations.  These are used for relative weighting of components when fitting the 
            model.  The residual stats are based on the 95%ile of the difference between the 
            observed and model values. (These may need some refinement)
            </li>
            <li>
            The table of model components.  Each component has a "Use" status, which can be used to
            remove the component from the model, but still keep information about it, and a Fit? status,
            discussed below.  A component can be selected to display its parameters in the box to the right.
            </li>
            <li>Remove:  Completely removes the selected compojnent from the model</li>
            <li>Add: To add a new component, select the type of component and the date at which it applies,
            then click the add button.  The date can be selected by clicking on the time series plots.
            </li>
            <li>Event: An optional name for the component, eg the name of an earthquake, or a description of 
            equipment change</li>
            <li>Component parameter tables: Each parameter has a Fit? status, a name, a value, and an
            error.  The error is the estimated error from the last fitting operation applied to the 
            model.  It uses light grey text if this was not the last fit actually done.</li>
            <li>Fit: when this is clicked the editor will recalculate the currently selected parameters to
            the time series.  The selected parameters are those of the current component, and those of any
            other component with the Fit? status set. The fit uses the scipy leastsq function 
            which is a wrapper around MINPACK's lmdif and lmder algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>Fit: when this is clicked the editor will recalculate all linear parameters of all 
            enabled components for which the parameter Fit? status is selected.  The fit status of the 
            components are ignored (all enabled components are used).  Linear parameters include velocities
            and offsets, but not event dates and durations.
            The fit uses the scipy leastsq function 
            which is a wrapper around MINPACK's lmdif and lmder algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>Undo: reverses the last change made to the model</li>
            <li>Redo: redo the last change reversed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Directly under the plot are a set of controls for managing the plots.  From right to left these are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home button: returns the view to original unzoomed state</li>
            <li>Previous view button: returns the view to previous zoom state</li>
            <li>Next view button: go to next view after previous</li>
            <li>Pan button: click to start panning the plots</li>
            <li>Zoom button: click to start selecting areas to zoom in to</li>
            <li>Use obs button: click to start picking observations to include or exclude from the model fit</li>
            <li>Use all obs button: click to clear the list of unused observations</li>
            <li>Auto reject button: click to automatically select observations to reject</li>
            <li>Save plot button: click to save a copy of the current plot as a PNG file<li>
            fit and statistics.  Note: this won't work will the zoom or pan buttons are selected - to be 
            tidied up!</li>
            <li>Detrend checkbox: Select or unselect to remove the trend from the plots.  Normally selected to 
            make it easier to see details of the plots
            </li>
            <li>Time as days checkbox: Select to show the date axis as days after 1 Jan 2000 rather than as dates</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>To do list</h1>
        <p>GUI improvements: 
        Fix the handling of the include/exclude control with the other plot control buttons 
        and the plot cursor state.  
        Add a list of tectonic events to the plot that can by used to select an event for a 
        new component.  
        Option to display an individual component on the plot.
        Display the location of the station.
